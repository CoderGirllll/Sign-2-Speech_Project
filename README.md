# Sign-2-Speech_Project
Sign Language to Speech Conversion System â€“ Project Brief
Objective:
To bridge the communication gap between the deaf/mute community and the hearing population by converting sign language gestures into audible speech in real time.

Problem Statement:
People with speech and hearing impairments often struggle to communicate with others who do not understand sign language. There is a need for a real-time, portable, and affordable system that can interpret sign language and convert it into spoken words.

Proposed Solution:
A wearable or mobile-based AI system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to:

Capture sign language gestures (via camera, e.g., sunglasses-mounted or smartphone).

Interpret the gestures using deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).

Convert recognized signs into speech output using a text-to-speech engine.

Key Features:
1)Real-time gesture recognition
2)Multilingual speech output
3)Lightweight and user-friendly design
4)Works offline or with limited connectivity
5)Customizable vocabulary
6)Technology Stack:
Hardware: Camera (e.g., on smart glasses), Microcontroller (optional), Speaker
Software:
Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch, CNN for image classification

TTS: pyttsx3 / gTTS

Platform: Python, Android (for mobile deployment)

Applications:
1)Communication aid for the hearing impaired
2)Inclusive education tools
3)Customer service desks
4)Public service interactions (hospitals, banks, etc.)

Future Enhancements:
Integration of facial expressions and body posture for more context

Bidirectional communication (speech to sign language)

Cloud-based real-time translation and voice modulation
